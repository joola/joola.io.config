## Overview
[joola.io][22] is a distributed data processing and visualization framework. The framework is designed as an end-to-end
solution for data analytics. The framework connects to your databases and using a JSON based mapping of dimensions and
metrics, it exposes a RESTful API for querying the data. The Client SDK communicates with the engine to display,
visualize and provide insight into the data. Developers can extend the framework in many ways, add data connectors,
authentication plugins, visualizations and more.

To learn more about the framework architecture, see our [documentation site][1].

## The Config Node
joola.io.config is based on an [express][31] HTTP server exposing a single interface ```conf```. When this endpoint is reached with a path indicating the config to load, the server will return the JSON file.
Configuration files are kept under the ```store``` folder.

### Installing
```bash
$ npm install joola.io.config
```

### Using
```
curl http://localhost:40001/conf/joola.io.analytics
```

#### Using with [nconf-http][30]
```
var nconf = require('nconf');

require('nconf-http');

nconf.argv()
  .env();

nconf.use('http', { url: 'http://localhost:40001/conf/joola.io.analytics',
  callback: function () {
    console.log('config loaded')
  }
});
```
